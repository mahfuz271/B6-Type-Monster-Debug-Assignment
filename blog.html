        <h2>Difference between localstorage and sessionstorage</h3>
            <p><br>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't
                expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
                particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.
                <br><br>

            <h2>Difference between global scope and block scope</h3>
                <p><br>In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js,
                    it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for
                    statements, and the like.<br><br></p>

                <h2>how javascript event loop works
                    </h3>
                    <p><br>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the
                        Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to
                        the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

                    <h2>when we get undefined in javascript
                        </h3>
                        <p><br>A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or
                            statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an
                            assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned .</p>
